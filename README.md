     Making this website was extremely enjoyable yet challenging. In fact, making critical decisions became the most challenging aspect of building the site. For example, the business owner of the website requested that the color scheme should represent nature and agriculture. Therefore, we chose the color scheme from a photo used on the main page of the website. The colors are dark green, black, brown, and white because we believed that this color scheme would suit the owner’s request. In addition, the format of the website was intended to be bulky yet fairly elegant and straight to the point. Therefore, we used a checker pattern format on the main page and a line pattern of information and photos on the subpages. These patterns also gave the website a masculine feeling which is what the customers of this website would enjoy. 
     We met the business owner, Dale Springfield, through Thad who worked for the client over the summer. Since Thad helped Dale scout his farmer’s fields,  he has an understanding of the client’s preferences. Now, we have spent countless hours to build a website to suit the business and Dale’s expectations the best way possible.
    There are still many more minor details that helped us in the building of the website. Thad and Saylor both coded the website together and worked every chance possible to succeed. Thad also did all of the photography on the entire webpage. Making this website has allowed us to learn many things and how to work harder.
